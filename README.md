GRANDMASFOOD
Project developed for the GrandmasFood business.
This project implements microservices using hexagonal architecture, which facilitates scalability, maintainability, and a clear separation between the domain, application, and infrastructure layers, ensuring proper communication between ports and adapters.
Additionally, for integration testing, an in-memory H2 database is used, allowing the complete behavior of endpoints and services to be validated in an isolated, safe, and reproducible environment..
